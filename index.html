<p1><b>The Inheritance Trilogy</b></p1>
<hr>
<p><i>" All 3 books in the trilogy take place in the same world in chronological order, so reading them out of order causes major spoilers for the previous books. There are overlapping characters and plot points, and actions in one book have consequences in the next. For the most part there is not a continuous plot between the books, but you could argue that there is a continuous narrative surrounding how the fictional world changes over time due to the combined events of the books."</i></p>

<p1><b>Shiva Trilogy</b></p1>
<hr>
<p><i>"Depicting the gods of hindu mythology as human beings while maintaining the original characteristics for which they are worshipped for is the speciality of this series. I believe that if the story narrated was assumed to be true, instead of the actual mythology, it would still not lessen the respect that these deities engender. The story itself was innovative and gripping until the very end. Lots of respect for this masterpiece."</i></p>

<p1><b>Game of Thrones</b></p1>
<hr>
<p><i>"I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time. Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched. So, when I came back to fantasy I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!"</i></p>
